# Exercise 2 - Provision SAP backend roles to Microsoft Entra ID

In the previous exercise we have all the necessary authorizations from our backend systems. Now we have to synchronize them to the identity management solution. In this scenario the identity management solution is your Entra ID tenant.

## Exercise 2.1 Trigger groups synchronization to Entra ID


1. Navigate to your **Source Systems**.
2. Choose the source system **Local Directory** and navigate to the tab **Jobs**. 
3. Run the job.
4. Navigate to Provisioning Logs and check the provisioning status and the details. You will notice that you have only created groups in your **BestRunCorp Tenant** tenant


## Summary

You've now provisioned the SAP groups to your identity management solution. Continue with the next exercise to assign these authorizations to users.
